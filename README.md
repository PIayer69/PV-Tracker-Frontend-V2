# PV Statistics Tracker
App designed for PV users, who are interested how their investment is doing. My second Rest Framework and ReactJS project, on which I want to keep working till it becomes client-ready app.

## Disclaimer! It's only design with stock data, there isn't any connections to the backend made yet.
